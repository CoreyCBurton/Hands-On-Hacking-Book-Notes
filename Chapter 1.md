# Chapter 1: Hacking a Business Case

# Blue team
* known as white hat defenders; They analyze security 

* analyse information systems, identify security flaws, and make sure all security methods continue to be effective

* IT help-desk, system patches, back up and restore staff, basic security tool managers, and etc.

* Goal is to see where the attack is taking place and to stop it 

# Red team 
* Independent groups of professionals who challange an organization to improve effectivness 

* A specific objective is set by the red team and they try to achieve it. 

* The red team then communicates with the blue team to talk about how to make things secure.

* A pen tester is not apart of red team; They work alone and dont expect to do an in depth attack like the red team does 

* Big companies and U.S. governments use red teams while small buisness owners use a pen tester who often on an annual bases checks your network.

* There are obstacles on why companies cant take action on pen tester or red team reports

1. **Inadequate training** Blue teams often don't know how to act upon the reports due to a lack of skills outside of common taks. Upgrading firewalls, updating software, and changing passwords.

2. **Lack of resources** Many corporations say that their cybersecurity teams are understaffed; More people are needed 

3. **Limited Time** It is hard for companies to redirect staff resources to repatch vulnerabilities

4. **Lack of Incentives** Motivation for staff to go through long penetration reports

# Purple team 
* Team of exports who take on the role of both red and blue team 

* They anticipate attacks by addressing them before they can be exploited

* Explain social engineering more in depth than other teams

* Social engineering, pentesting, vulnerability management, patching, etc.

# Hacking is apart of a Company's Immune System
* Companies need to know their weak spots. 

* Breaking into your own home is like a company finding its vulnerabilies; It can be done. 

* Small buissnesses cant survive cyber security attacks

* The purple team is an excellent team to communicate policies; Human error is common for breaches to happen so they need to be educated.
