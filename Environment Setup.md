# Introducion
For this book, it requires you to set up multiple virtual machines to test different vulnerable programs. The virtual machine I will use is VMware fusion, it is perfect for everything that is needed. All the things done in this repo is on a Mac, so if you are running windows it will be quite differnet. I am using Kali linux as the OS to pen test. Lets get started but what has to be done on Kali Linux.

# Kali Linux set up
**Connecting Kali Linux to the internet**
Once you do the basic setup for Kali Linux by using an .ISO on VMware, you will notice that the OS isnt connected to the internet. There is a simple solution to this, On macOS, there is a virtual machine tab on the menu bar. Once you click on it, go to network adapter > Bridged (Autodetect). To determine that your machine is connected, you can ping google.com to see if it returns that packets have gone through.
