# Introducion
For this book, it requires you to set up multiple virtual machines to test different vulnerable programs. The virtual machine I will use is VMware fusion, it is perfect for everything that is needed. All the things done in this repo is on a Mac, so if you are running windows it will be quite differnet. I am using Kali linux as the OS to pen test. Lets get started but what has to be done on Kali Linux.

# Kali Linux set up : Connecting to the Internet.
Once you do the basic setup for Kali Linux by using an .ISO on VMware, you will notice that the OS isnt connected to the internet. There is a simple solution to this. On macOS, there is a virtual machine tab on the menu bar. Once you click on it, go to network adapter > Bridged (Autodetect). To determine that your machine is connected, you can ping google.com to see if it any packets. Now that you have Kali Linux on your machine, the next step is to set up the three operating systems that we are going to pen test which are, Windows XP, Windows 7, and Ubuntu.

# Windows XP Environment Setup.

Once you find the WindowsXP service pack 3 ISO, it is time to set up the environment so we can penetrate it.
