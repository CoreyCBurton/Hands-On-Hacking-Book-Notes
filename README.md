# Kali-Linux-Penetration-Testing
# Introduction 
Kali Linux is an amazing Ubuntu fork, it has plenty of tools to learn how to pen test. As a student learning infosec, it is crucial that I learn how software and netwroks can be vulnerable. This repo is going to be based on the amazing book **Penetration testing a Hands-on introduction to Hacking by Georgia Weidman**. The downside of this book is that it is made in 2014 but it still has the general idea and up-to-date concepts. Let the pen testing begin.

# Goals for this repo
- Learn Kali linux 
- Learn different operating systems and how they work
- How to penetrate a vulnerable network
- learn why an appliciaiton can be vulnerable
